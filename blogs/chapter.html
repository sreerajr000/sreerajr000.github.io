Eyes sunken, shamelessly trying to make an emotion, cheeks, dark dry lips, so dead, like windscathed meadow, hair, ironically standing facial hairs, all accenting that one nose bridge. If its just the morning or me, distinction was a long stretch for me. I wish I could make that distinction as effortlessly as those glass pieces did. Rather than just wallowing at a "what could have been".
